# openmog
Autonomous AI agent swarm orchestrator

# Bootstrap
Initialize this source code project with the artifacts to direct an AI coding agent to contribute. Ensure that these artifacts are maximally portable across AI coding agents including Cline, Claude Code, Codex, and kilocode. Expect that skills will be added. Choose the programming language and supply chain ecosystem that is most well suited to this project. Provide a document for contributor on-boarding that provides steps to initialize a freshly installed VS Code with the necessary extensions to be productive in that programming language and ecosystem.

openmog will be directed by configuration files that control:
- **purpose**: specifies what this openmog instance is intended to accomplish as its on-going concern
- **limits**: specifies guardrails and constraints
- **contacts**: specifies addresses for collaborators to communicate for delegating tasks for review, approval, and requesting assistance
- **settings**: controls settings, options, integrations, and the selection of which AI model to use

openmog will bootstrap this source code project to implement a complete autonomous AI agent that can use the chosen LLM (model) for reasoning, planning, and formulating actions. openmog will be used to instantiate at least one deployment of itself for the purpose of developing improvements to its own capabilities through code changes to this source code project working in collaboration with other deployment instances of openmog or with human contributors.
